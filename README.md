## 🤔 What Is DataFoundry

When teams let AI query enterprise databases, the real worry is never "can the model write SQL." It is: **does it understand business definitions? Could it mutate production data? Could credentials leak into context? Can a conclusion be verified after the fact?**

Most tools reduce the problem to `prompt → SQL → answer` — impressive in a demo, dead on arrival in the enterprise. DataFoundry takes a different path: **it puts the agent inside a semantic, policy-aware, evidence-preserving data task system**, upgrading natural-language analytics into controllable, trustworthy, verifiable data work.

## ✨ Core Capabilities

- 🗄️ **28 datasource types, ready out of the box** — From PostgreSQL, MySQL, Snowflake, BigQuery, and ClickHouse to MongoDB, Redis, and Elasticsearch: connect your existing data stack quickly, cut integration cost, and get the agent into real business analysis faster.
- 🧠 **Enterprise semantics and context organization** — Manage schema, metric definitions, and field relationships in one place, so terms like "GMV" and "retention" resolve to enterprise-approved tables, fields, and definitions — fewer guessed fields, wrong joins, and definition drift, and fundamentally better accuracy.
- 🏠 **Self-hosted deployment and multi-model support** — Run it inside your own boundary so data never leaves; on the model side, any OpenAI-compatible provider works (Qwen, DeepSeek, GPT, ...), letting you balance security, cost, latency, and quality per scenario.
- 🔒 **Safe by default, auditable throughout** — Read-only queries, credential isolation, field masking, row limits, and timeouts by default; SQL, tool calls, and event streams are fully persisted and replayable, so every conclusion is backed by evidence.
- 🧩 **Deep optimization for complex data tasks** — Built for multi-table, multi-field, long-horizon analysis and multi-step reasoning: complex questions get decomposed, verified, and converged into trustworthy conclusions, materialized as tables, charts, and reports the team can reuse.

## 🆕 What's New In v0.2.0

DataFoundry 0.2 turns the first usable workbench into a more complete, stateful data-agent workflow:

- **Branchable, concurrent analysis** — Keep multiple sessions running, queue follow-up prompts, restore completed work, and branch from an earlier question or checkpoint without overwriting the original path.
- **Evidence-first follow-ups** — Reference a complete output or a selected table/text region in the next question; resolved evidence is carried into the governed run context with diagnostics.
- **Semantic trace and DataLink integration** — Inspect checkpoint-backed run structure in a semantic Trace DAG. Connect an external DataLink service to map tables and columns to business concepts, entities, joinable paths, and confidence-scored relationships for stronger agent grounding.
- **Reusable outputs and workspace assets** — Preview and export tables, charts, reports, SQL, and files; upload files into an active session, then promote supported files for reuse across sessions.
- **Production-facing Web foundation** — Built-in password authentication, same-origin API proxying, bilingual UI, model connection tests, onboarding, and an auto-provisioned DTC growth analysis case.

See the [v0.2.0 release notes](docs/en/releases/v0.2.0.md) for the complete capability and documentation audit.

## 🚀 Formal deploy

Formal mode has two paths (do **not** run `npm run dev`). Docker / Compose is not provided in this release.

### Recommended: Ubuntu / Debian one-click

`./deploy.sh` generates configuration, installs dependencies, builds (Web, API, and TUI), and starts Web + API as a detached background process — closing the terminal does not stop the stack. The TUI is built and ready but is a foreground client: start it in another terminal with `./deploy.sh tui` (or `npm run start:tui`); it does **not** stay running with the stack. DataLink is an **external** component (not started by deploy) — connect it later via MCP in the Web UI if needed. No model key is required during deploy — create and enable a model profile in the Web UI after login. Does **not** support native Windows / macOS.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/datagallery-lab/datafoundry.git
cd datafoundry
./deploy.sh
```

If a complete `.env` already exists, interactive deploy skips the configuration questions. To change ports or the public URL (secrets are preserved; `.env` is backed up first):

```bash
./deploy.sh deploy --reconfigure
```

Common management commands:

```bash
./deploy.sh status
./deploy.sh start
./deploy.sh stop
./deploy.sh logs
./deploy.sh doctor
./deploy.sh tui      # optional: foreground TUI client (API must already be up)
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:3000/login`, register or sign in, create an OpenAI-compatible model profile, then go to `/data-tasks`. For remote hosts set `AUTH_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`. Re-running `./deploy.sh deploy` uses a maintenance window (stop the managed process group before install/build).

### Windows / macOS / other: manual npm

On native Windows, macOS, or other non-Ubuntu/Debian hosts, use manual npm. Install and run in the same environment; on Windows, do not share `node_modules` between Windows and WSL.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/datagallery-lab/datafoundry.git
cd datafoundry
npm install
cp .env.example .env
cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env.local
```

Configure any OpenAI-compatible model in the root `.env`, plus auth for formal test or real production (sample defaults lean formal test):

```bash
LLM_PROVIDER=openai-compatible
LLM_MODEL=qwen-plus                # or deepseek-chat, gpt-4o, ...
LLM_BASE_URL=https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1
LLM_API_KEY=replace-with-your-key

AUTH_SESSION_SECRET=replace-with-at-least-32-random-characters
AUTH_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3000   # real production: https://your.domain
AUTH_REGISTRATION_MODE=open
AUTH_EMAIL_DELIVERY=test                     # real production: smtp + AUTH_SMTP_*
```

`apps/web/.env.local`:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_AGENT_RUNTIME_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONFIG_API_URL=
API_PROXY_TARGET=http://127.0.0.1:8787
```

Build and start:

```bash
npm run build
npm run build:web
npm run start        # Web :3000 + API :8787
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:3000/login`, register or sign in, go to `/data-tasks`, and ask:

```text
Show me the tables in this datasource and explain the main fields of each.
```

You will see the full chain: schema inspection → read-only SQL → SQL audit → table output → replayable run history.

For real production, also configure SMTP and a reverse proxy: [`deploy/nginx.datafoundry.conf.example`](deploy/nginx.datafoundry.conf.example) (gzip/brotli static assets; keep `/api/copilotkit` uncompressed and unbuffered for SSE).

> Full steps, the two-environment matrix, and optional external DataLink notes: [Quick Start](docs/en/quick-start.md). Contributor hot-reload (`npm run dev`) is appendix-only. Connect your own PostgreSQL / MySQL / CSV and more: [Data Sources guide](docs/en/guides/data-sources.md).


## 🆚 How It Differs From Coding Agents And SQL Chatbots

Coding agents change code, SQL chatbots answer questions, DataFoundry runs data tasks — three different operating objects, risk boundaries, and outputs:

| | Works on | Main risk | Output |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Coding agent | Repos, tests, PRs | Breaking code | Patch, commit, PR |
| SQL chatbot | Prompt, SQL, answer | Wrong tables, unsafe access, leaked credentials, no replay | A SQL snippet or an answer |
| **DataFoundry** | Datasources, files, knowledge, tools, task state | Production data boundaries, business semantics, audit evidence | **Replayable data tasks** + SQL audit + tables / charts / reports |

On data tasks specifically, DataFoundry's core advantages over a general-purpose coding agent are:

- **Accuracy, from data constraints** — Pointed at a database, a coding agent tends to guess tables, fields, and definitions; DataFoundry enforces schema-first analysis and constrains query paths through Data Gateway, cutting guessed fields and wrong joins.
- **Safety, from controlled execution** — Coding agents run commands and write files: powerful, but high-risk against enterprise data. DataFoundry defaults to read-only SQL, credential isolation, field masking, row limits, timeouts, and audit — built for real data environments.
- **Speed, from a converging task path** — Not because the model reasons faster, but because datasource selection, schema caching, context budgeting, tool policy, and the artifact pipeline eliminate wasted attempts, so analysis converges on results sooner.
- **Complex tasks, from data-workflow design** — Coding agents excel at code engineering; DataFoundry is built for analysis across many tables, fields, and metrics plus knowledge bases, files, and report outputs, chaining "query, verify, explain, materialize" into one complete flow.
- **Adoption, from an enterprise runtime** — This is not a demo: the Web workbench, TUI, REST API, CopilotKit / AG-UI, Data Gateway, Skills, MCP, Files, Artifacts, and Metadata combine into an operating foundation for data agents.

## ⚙️ How A Data Task Runs

```text
Ask → Align semantics → Execute under control → Materialize output → Replay & review
```

1. **Define the task** — Pick datasources, files, knowledge, and tools, then describe the business question in natural language.
2. **Align meaning with structure** — The agent inspects schema and available context first, grounding terms like "GMV" or "retention" in real tables and fields.
3. **Execute under control** — Data Gateway runs queries inside a read-only boundary with SQL guardrails, row limits, timeouts, and masking; every SQL statement leaves an audit record.
4. **Materialize output** — Results become tables, charts, reports, or files — assets the team can cite.
5. **Replay and review** — Web, TUI, and API share one run history, so every step's evidence is always one click away.

## 🖥️ More Than A Chat Box

The **Web workbench** fits day-to-day analysis and demos, the **TUI** fits terminals and remote servers, and the **API / CopilotKit / AG-UI** path lets you embed the same trusted runtime into your own product.

</p>

## 🗄️ Bring Your Data Stack, No Rebuild

Connect through Data Gateway adapters: the built-in DTC Growth Review case works out of the box; DuckDB, SQLite, CSV, Excel, PostgreSQL, and MySQL fit local trials; cloud warehouses, search engines, and NoSQL systems plug in with their own services and credentials.

See the full list in [Supported Data Sources](docs/en/reference/supported-datasources.md).

## 🛡️ Security Boundary

- The model only receives governed context; datasource credentials, model API keys, and MCP tokens never enter `messages`, `context`, or `forwardedProps`.
- All datasource access goes through Data Gateway — read-only by default, with SQL guardrails, row limits, timeouts, and field masking.
- SQL audit logs, tool-call records, and event streams are fully persisted for after-the-fact review.
- Production-grade multi-tenant auth, centralized secret management, monitoring, and deployment operations require a dedicated design for your environment — see [Security](docs/en/security.md).

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- [x] **Governed data-task workbench** — Web and TUI share one TypeScript agent runtime, CopilotKit / AG-UI event stream, replayable run history, SQL audit trail, and unified asset layer.
- [x] **Safe data access foundation** — Datasource registration, connection testing, schema introspection, table preview, read-only SQL, masking, knowledge imports, MCP resources, skill packages, and model configuration.
- [ ] **Unified semantic layer** — Durable metrics, entities, relationships, lineage, and policies, moving agents from "guessing fields" to "understanding business definitions" and from one-off SQL to a governable data operating layer.
- [ ] **Autonomous analyst loops** — Agents that plan investigations, run controlled experiments, critique findings, and converge on evidence-backed conclusions.
- [ ] **Evaluation and reliability lab** — NL2SQL, retrieval, tool-use, and end-to-end task benchmarks with regression gates and failure forensics.
- [ ] **Enterprise control plane** — Identity, RBAC, approvals, audit export, policy-as-code, and cost limits.

## 🤝 Contributing

DataFoundry moves quickly, so small, well-scoped PRs are the easiest to merge:

1. Open an issue or discussion first for behavioral, protocol, datasource-adapter, or agent-policy changes.
2. Keep each PR focused on one runtime boundary or feature area.
3. Run `npm run build` plus the targeted smoke checks for what you touched (e.g. `npm run smoke:data-gateway`).
4. Update docs when a change affects setup, APIs, datasource configuration, or user-visible output.
5. Do not commit credentials, local databases, generated storage, or private benchmark data.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.
